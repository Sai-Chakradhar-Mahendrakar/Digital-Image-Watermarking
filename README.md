# Digital Image Watermarking

## Overview
This project implements a Java-based application that allows users to watermark digital images with customizable text. It features a simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java Swing and AWT, where users can load images, add watermarks, and customize the appearance of the watermark (e.g., font, color, size). This tool is useful for adding ownership or branding to images while maintaining ease of use.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Load any image file to the application.
- **Text Watermarking**: Add custom text as a watermark to your image.
- **Customization Options**: Adjust font style, size, and color of the watermark text.
- **Save Watermarked Image**: Save the watermarked image to your local system.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: The application uses Java Swing for a responsive and intuitive interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Java SE**: Core Java is used to develop the application logic.
- **Swing and AWT**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **ImageIO**: For handling image loading and saving.
